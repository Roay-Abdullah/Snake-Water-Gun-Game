# Snake Water Gun – Python GUI Game

This is my **first complete Python project**, where I implemented the classic **Snake–Water–Gun** game using **Python and Tkinter**.  
I built this project to practice my **Programming Fundamentals (PF)** and **Data Structures (DS)** concepts, and to explore how Python’s built-in **GUI library** works in real applications.

## 📌 About This Project

As a beginner in Python, my goal with this project was to move beyond console programs and create something **interactive and visual**.  
This game helped me understand how logic, data structures, and user interaction come together in a real program.

The focus of this repository is **learning by building**, rather than creating a complex or optimized game.

## 🎯 What I Aimed to Learn

- Strengthen my understanding of **Python basics**
- Practice **PF and DS syntax** in a real project
- Learn **event-driven programming**
- Work with **Tkinter GUI widgets**
- Build confidence in completing Python projects independently

---

## 🎮 Game Rules

- **Snake beats Water**
- **Water beats Gun**
- **Gun beats Snake**
- Same choice by both players results in a **Tie**

---

## ✨ Features

- Simple and interactive **Tkinter-based GUI**
- Buttons for user input
- Random computer choices
- Live score tracking
- Clean and beginner-friendly code structure

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (Python’s built-in GUI library)
- **Random** module

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Requirements
- Python **3.x** installed on your system

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Roay-Abdullah/Snake-Water-Gun-Game.git
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Snake-Water-Gun-Game

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py


## 📚 Concepts I Practiced

- Variables and data types
- Dictionaries
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Global vs local variables
- GUI widgets (Button, Label)
- Event handling
- Basic game logic implementation


## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Improve the GUI layout and design
- Add images or icons for Snake, Water, and Gun
- Add a Restart Game button
- Refactor the code using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Add sound effects for better user experience*
